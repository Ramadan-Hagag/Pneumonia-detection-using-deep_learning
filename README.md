# Pneumonia-detection-using-deep_learning
# Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically the cnn and  the VGG16 convolutional neural network, to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The models are trained on a dataset consisting of images labeled as either "normal" or "pneumonia".
 # Model Architecture
The VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is employed as the base model. The top layers of VGG16 are adapted to fit the binary classification task of pneumonia detection. The model is fine-tuned by freezing the convolutional base and training only the custom classifier layers.
# Training
The model is compiled with:

1-Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy, suitable for multi-class classification.

2-Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient weight updates.

3-Metrics: Accuracy metric to monitor model performance during training.

The training process involves iterating through batches of augmented images generated by ImageDataGenerator, optimizing the model parameters to minimize the loss function.
# Prediction
Once trained, the model can make predictions on new chest X-ray images to classify them as either normal or indicating pneumonia. The predictions are based on the highest probability output from the softmax layer of the model.

# Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

-Keras

-TensorFlow

-Matplotlib

-NumPy
# Future Improvements
-Incorporate more advanced architectures like ResNet or DenseNet for potentially improved performance.

-Experiment with different augmentation techniques to further enhance model generalization.
